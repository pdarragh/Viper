# Viper

Viper is a statically-typed language similar to (and inspired by) Python. It provides many of the same features as
Python, and compiles to Python, but it isn't Python.

## Motive

I like Python a lot, but there are some areas where I find it to be lacking. In particular, I miss static types and
recursively-defined data structures. I decided to start this project to address these "needs" (if they can be so
called).
